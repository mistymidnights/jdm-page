            <p>If you have ever heard about JDM, then it means 
                “Japanese Domestic Market.” The term refers to 
                the vehicles that are manufactured by the Japanese 
                automotive companies for their domestic market.<br>
                A common myth or misconception attached with the term JDM 
                is that any car produced in Japan is called a JDM car, but 
                that is not true. JDM specifically means the vehicles that 
                are made in Japan and sold in Japan’s local market. JDM cars 
                are not produced for the international market.</p>
